Hello there! ~~General Ken...~~ Uh uh... Oh, right! Welcome to our new website! 

In a world where we have single page apps, PWA's, augmented reality and so forth, we decided to bring you this: a static website! Yaaay!

Anyways. This website will have news from the studio, devlogs and some tutorials for anyone who'd like to get into game development. 

For more _real time_ updates, please, consider following us on our [twitter](https://twitter.com/enumoxstudio) :)

All the best,
Guilherme.
